_This Application is about a **Pet Talk**_.<br/>
_version: 12/04/2019_<br/>

_By **Josh Hortt**_

## Description
_A Webpage that says something different back to the user: Using a dialog (Q & A) between Cat and Dog_.<br/>
_Pet Talk app manipulates the DOM elements by inserting new text with the jQuery **.prepend() method**_, <br/>
_by clicking the **button**, the **.prepend() method** will insert the text of the argument, given into_<br/>
_to the top of the **unordered list** as the first child of the **unordered list**_.<br/>
_After adding something to the DOM, it uses also the **.remove() method** to remove what was added from it_,<br/>
_when a user clicks a message, it disappears_.<br/>
_I also attached **handlers** to the message most recently inserted. Since those are inserted at the top of each **list**_,<br/>
_the user can select one of the **unordered lists**, look through its **child elements** of the *list**, and select the **first** one of them_.
